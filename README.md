# Dev Social Network App - FullStack React App

This App is done using React. In this case, I used `create-react-app` + `Node.JS` + `Express.js` + `MongoDB`. The goal of this project was to practice my MERN Stack skills. The App uses `Redux` to manage the state from a central store.

# Quick Start

1. Init a new repo: `git init`.
1. Clone the repo: `https://github.com/sportiz91/dev-social-mern.git`.
1. CD over `dev-social-mern` folder.
1. Install all dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn add`.
1. Run it locally on your machine: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.

# Next Steps

Nope :). Everything's done!

# Learnings

- ## Global Learnings:
      * More practice into React, Basic Hooks (useState, useEffect), Components & Props.
      * Redux! That was difficult...
      * MERN Stack
      * JWT
      * BCRYPT
      * And a lot more...
    
# Special Considerations

Some of the components are done with the old connect api from Redux, and some are done with the new hooks `useDispatch` & `useSelector`. That's because I wanted to learn both APIs.
